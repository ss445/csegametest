            <div><p>This is how to calculate your estimated recycling;<br />First determine what type of recycling bin you have, and its dimensions in gallons. The most Typical size for a homeowner is a 64 or 96 gallon cart.<br />It is also good to remember that recycling goes out only once every two weeks.<br />Now estimate the percentange of how full it is everytime you put it out for pickup.<br />Next, plug those numbers into this formula;<br />(size in gallons) * (0.75 pounds/gallon) * (weeks of picked up recycling) = total pounds recycled<br />Now you can directly compare your amount with the values from the charts, just divide your amount by the chart's and you will get the percentage of how much you have contributed.<br />( It will be tough to look at, but every bit counts so keep recycling ! )</p><div>
